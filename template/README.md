# Skill Template

Use this template as a starting point for creating new skills.

## Getting Started

1. Copy this template directory
2. Rename it to match your skill name (use lowercase with hyphens)
3. Edit `SKILL.md` with your skill's instructions
4. Update the frontmatter fields:
   - `name`: Unique identifier (lowercase, hyphens for spaces)
   - `description`: Complete description of what the skill does and when to use it

## Required Files

- `SKILL.md` - Main skill file with YAML frontmatter and instructions (required)
- `README.md` - Documentation for developers (optional but recommended)

## Optional Files

You can include additional resources in your skill directory:
- Scripts or code files
- Configuration files
- Data files
- Images or assets
- Example files

## Best Practices

- Keep instructions clear and concise
- Provide specific examples of usage
- Include edge cases and error handling guidance
- Test your skill thoroughly before deploying
- Document any dependencies or requirements

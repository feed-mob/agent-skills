# Logo Overlay Guidance

## Core Instructions

- Preserve the subject identity and all existing details.
- Place the logo on a natural surface (shirt, sign, device, packaging).
- Match lighting, perspective, and material texture.
- Keep edges crisp and avoid warping the logo excessively.
- Do not alter faces or key features.

## Prompt Snippet

# Prompt Guide (Gemini Image Generation)

## Best Practices

- Describe the scene in full sentences, not just keywords.
- Specify subject, environment, lighting, lens/camera, and mood.
- Call out composition or framing (close-up, wide, overhead).
- Mention aspect ratio or orientation explicitly when important.
- Use concrete materials and textures (linen, brushed metal, matte).
